        <br> A burger or bwerger is nearly as nice as a pizza, sometimes it is better. It depends what you fancy today.

        <p>
            A burger can be made from meat or vegtables. A bwerger is always meat. The best meat should always be used. A good ratio is chuck 20/80. But if you have some waggu beef lying around you can use that too.
